# About PyPD

PyPD is a python library for libpd. It's an object oriented wrapper around the standard python bindings that libpd ships with.

## Requirements

PyPD requires a working installation of [libpd](https://github.com/libpd/libpd) and `pylibpd`. `pyaudio` is required for sonification.

## Installation

One you have met and tested the requirements, simply clone this repo and install with `easy_install`.

```
$ python setup.py develop
```

Doing it this way means you can keep up to date by just pulling the repo.

## Documentation

There is none (yet)! Check out the examples folder and the unit tests, but the usage should be pretty straight-forward.
